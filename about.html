      <h1>“What are we aiming at?”</h1>
      <blockquote>
        “The encouragement of research . . . and the advancement of individual
        scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue,
        and the society where they dwell.”
      </blockquote>

        Gilman believed that teaching and research go hand in hand—that success
        in one depends on success in the other—and that a modern university must
        do both well. He also believed that sharing our knowledge and
        discoveries would help make the world a better place.

        In 145 years, we haven’t strayed from that vision. This is still a
        destination for excellent, ambitious scholars and a world leader in
        teaching and research. Distinguished professors mentor students in the
        arts and music, humanities, social and natural sciences, engineering,
        international studies, education, business, and the health professions.
        Those same faculty members, along with their colleagues at the
        university’s Applied Physics Laboratory, have made us the nation’s
        leader in federal research and development funding every year since 1979
